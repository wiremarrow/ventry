## 🏗️ Critical Architectural Decisions

### 1. tRPC Architecture Pattern (Factory Pattern)

**DECISION: Use factory pattern to avoid circular dependencies**

```
src/trpc/
├── builder.ts       # tRPC instance creation (no imports)
├── middleware.ts    # Middleware factory functions
├── procedures.ts    # Base procedures using middleware
├── trpc.ts         # Main export combining everything
└── context.ts      # Context creation (unchanged)
```

**Why**: 
- Avoids circular dependencies between trpc.ts and middleware.ts
- Follows separation of concerns
- Improves testability
- Aligns with tRPC best practices

### 2. Field Naming Convention

**DECISION: Use camelCase in application code, snake_case in database**

```
Database (PostgreSQL) → Prisma Schema → Application Code
snake_case           → camelCase      → camelCase
qty_ordered          → qtyOrdered     → order.qtyOrdered
created_at           → createdAt      → item.createdAt
```

**Why**: 
- Prisma acts as translation layer with `@@map` directives
- All existing code uses camelCase
- Changing would require massive refactoring
- TypeScript/JavaScript convention is camelCase

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Every query MUST be scoped to organizationId**

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
const items = await ctx.prisma.item.findMany();

// ✅ CORRECT
const items = await ctx.prisma.item.findMany({
  where: { organizationId: ctx.user.organizationId }
});
```

### 3. Procedure Types

**Always use organizationProcedure, NOT protectedProcedure**

```typescript
// ❌ OLD
export const router = router({
  list: protectedProcedure

// ✅ NEW
export const router = createTRPCRouter({
  list: organizationProcedure
```

---

## 🔧 Common Error Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern 1: Import Errors

**Error**: `Cannot find name 'createTRPCRouter'` or `Cannot find name 'organizationProcedure'`

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
import { protectedProcedure, router } from '../trpc.js';

// ✅ CORRECT
import { organizationProcedure, createTRPCRouter } from '../trpc/trpc.js';
```

### Pattern 2: Missing organizationId Scoping

**Error**: Data leaking across organizations

**Solution**: Add organizationId to ALL queries
```typescript
// For direct models with organizationId
where: { organizationId: ctx.user.organizationId }

// For related models (e.g., Inventory through Item)
where: {
  item: { organizationId: ctx.user.organizationId }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Non-Existent Fields

**Common Missing Fields**:
- Order: warehouseId, orderType, priority, expectedDate
- OrderItem: qtyBackordered
- Supplier: isActive
- Return: type, activities, receipt relationship
- Receipt: status field
- Item: minQuantity, maxQuantity, status (use isActive)
- Inventory: quantityAvailable, quantityAllocated (calculate from qtyOnHand - qtyReserved)
- Various models: activity, approval, allocation references

**Solution**: 
1. Remove the field reference
2. Add TODO comment if functionality needed
3. Use alternative fields if available (e.g., requestedShipDate instead of expectedDate)

### Pattern 4: Decimal Type Errors

**Error**: `Object is possibly 'null'` or arithmetic on Decimal

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG
const total = item.price * quantity;

// ✅ CORRECT
const total = Number(item.price) * quantity;
```

### Pattern 5: Status Enum Changes

**Old → New Status Mappings**:
- OrderStatus: SHIPPING → PICKING, PACKED, SHIPPED
- ReturnStatus: CANCELLED → REJECTED, COMPLETED → REFUNDED, SHIPPED → RECEIVED
- MovementType: RECEIPT → INBOUND, SHIPMENT → OUTBOUND
- PurchaseOrderStatus: Remove DRAFT if used

### Pattern 6: Relationship and Include Fixes

**Common Issues**:
- ReceiptItem doesn't have purchaseOrderItem relation
- Return doesn't have receipt or activities relations
- Inventory doesn't have direct expirationDate (through lot)
- StockMovement doesn't have direct organizationId (through item)
- StockMovement doesn't have item relation (need separate query)
- Location has 'code' not 'name' field

### Pattern 7: Complex Type Issues

**TypeScript Strict Mode Challenges**:
- Nested field filters require careful type construction
- Variable name conflicts in large files (e.g., itemIds redeclared)
- Aggregation functions need explicit type annotations
- Model dynamic access requires type assertions
- Enum indexing requires Record<string, number> type

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// For nested filters that might conflict
if (categoryIds?.length || !includeInactive) {
  inventoryWhere.item = {
    organizationId: ctx.user.organizationId,
    ...(categoryIds?.length ? { categoryId: { in: categoryIds } } : {}),
    ...(includeInactive ? {} : { isActive: true }),
  };
}

// For aggregations
const totalCost = items.reduce((sum: number, item: any) => sum + item.cost, 0);

// For dynamic model access
const results = await (model as any).findMany(queryOptions);
```

## ✅ Systematic Fix Process

1. **Fix Imports**
   ```bash
   # Replace all occurrences
   sed -i '' 's/protectedProcedure/organizationProcedure/g' <file>
   sed -i '' 's/router(/createTRPCRouter(/g' <file>
   ```

2. **Fix Import Path**
   - Change `../trpc.js` to `../trpc/trpc.js`

3. **Add organizationId Scoping**
   - Add to every `where` clause
   - Check if direct field or through relation

4. **Fix Field References**
   - Check against Prisma schema
   - Remove non-existent fields
   - Update enum values

5. **Fix Type Errors**
   - Add type annotations to reduce functions
   - Convert Decimal to Number for arithmetic
   - Handle optional fields with nullish coalescing

6. **Test Build**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @ventry/backend build 2>&1 | grep -E "src/routers/<filename>.*error TS" | wc -l
   ```

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **DON'T use protectedProcedure** - Always use organizationProcedure
2. **DON'T forget organizationId scoping** - Every query needs it
3. **DON'T assume fields exist** - Check schema first
4. **DON'T change schema** - Fix code to match schema
5. **DON'T use snake_case in code** - Use camelCase
6. **DON'T create new models** - Work with existing schema
7. **DON'T use findUnique without organizationId** - Use findFirst instead

## 🔍 Verification

After all routers are fixed:

1. **Build should succeed**:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @ventry/backend build
   ```

2. **Type checking should pass**:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   ```

3. **Linting should pass**:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

4. **Update documentation**:
   - TODO.md with completion status
   - README.md if needed

---

## 💡 Final Tips

1. **Read the Prisma schema** - It's the source of truth
2. **Check completed routers** - They show correct patterns
3. **Use TypeScript errors** - They guide what needs fixing
4. **Test incrementally** - Build after each major change
5. **Document TODOs** - For missing functionality
6. **Ask for clarification** - If architectural decision needed

Remember: The goal is to make the code compile with the new multi-tenant schema, not to add new features or change the schema. Stay focused on fixing compilation errors using the patterns established in completed routers.
